# Multiple-Sequence-Alignment

This Python script performs progressive multiple sequence alignment using dynamic programming.

## Introduction

This script utilizes dynamic programming to align multiple protein sequences progressively. It starts by performing pair-wise alignments of all sequences, and then creates a profile alignment using the pair-wise alignments. The code aims to showcase the basic steps of progressive multiple sequence alignment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or copy the script.
2. Open a terminal in the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```terminal
   python code.py

  1. Follow the prompts to provide the number of protein sequences and the sequences themselves.
